# PMDL
I will be adding the labs created for Practice Machine Deep learning course taken in AUC spring 2021.

## Opening the labs in Google Colaboratory

The labs will be run in Google's Colaboratory, a Jupyter notebook environment that runs entirely in the cloud, you don't need to download anything. To run these labs, you must have a Google account.

On this Github repo, navigate to the lab folder you want to run and open the appropriate python notebook (*.ipynb). Click the "Run in Colab" link on the top of the lab. That's it!

## Running the labs

Now, to run the labs, open the Jupyter notebook on Colab. Navigate to the "Runtime" tab --> "Change runtime type". In the pop-up window, under "Runtime type" select "Python 3", and under "Hardware accelerator" select "GPU".

## Navigating the labs

Use the following links to navigate through the labs:

* [Lab1: Linear Regression & Logistic Regression](lab1/Readme.md)
* [Lab2: Multinominal Classification](lab2/Readme.md)
* [Lab3: Convolutional Neural Networks Use Cases](lab3/Readme.md)
* [Lab4: Music Generation with RNNs](lab4/Readme.md)
* [Lab5: Visual Image Caption Generation](lab5/Readme.md)
* [Lab6: Cartpole - Reinforcement Learning](lab6/Readme.md)
* [Lab7: Generative Adversarial Networks](lab7/Readme.md)
